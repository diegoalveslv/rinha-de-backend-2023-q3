### Rinha de backend

Late implementation of a solution for a backend contest. 
The idea is to process the highest number of requests without any errors and as fast as possible given a limited resource.

Since the contest ended and there are implementations that beat the record, I've decided to
play a little and create a spring boot application in the most verbose way (which is the correct way :p)
possible just to see how it performs.
